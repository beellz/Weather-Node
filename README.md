## Guidelines for a newly joined Developer

      ## Our Workflow and Branching Strategy

Step 1: Picking Up an Issue.

It is time to pick an issue.
That is the best way to familiarise yourself with the codebase and the contribution guidelines.
You can view all Newcomer issues on the GitHub issue tab.

Important: You need to be logged in before you follow the Newcomer issues link.

We follow

    Workflow: Forking 
    Main Branch: Master

Before starting your first commit, check out the: JIRA ISSUE ID

Step 2: Fork the repository 

To fork the repository, go to the official repository click on the
``Fork`` button from the website interface. To add it locally.

Important

You mustn't make your changes on the master branch of your forked repository.

To start you can need to create a new branch where you will work on the issue. To do that run:

   ::

        $ git checkout -b <branchname>


step 3: Sending Your Changes

    You should be making changes and committing them to the respective branch.
    Added only the relevant files to commit
    Have updated the documentation pertaining to the commit
    Know the relevant Jira Issue ID 

    
    After making the changes, it is recommended that you test the code on your forked repository 


step 4: Creating a Pull Request

    Now that your commit has been sent to your fork, it is time to create a ``Pull Request``. You can do this by accessing your fork on GitHub
    and clicking ``New Pull Request``.


    Congratulations! You have now created your first Pull Request!

    Now contributors will review your work, comment on the requested improvements on your Pull Request.

step 5: Waiting for Review

    After creating your Pull Request, it enters the review process. You can see that's the case from the process/pending review label. Now all you have to do is wait, or let the other developers know on Gitter that you have published your changes.


**Congratulations!** Your PR just got accepted! You're awesome.
We highly encourage you to start other's issues after you complete your newcomer issue, as reviewing helps you to learn more.
